## Quick Formula Reference

### Rational Expressions
- **Domain Restriction:** Denominator ≠ 0
- **Division:** $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}$
- **LCD Method:** For addition/subtraction, find least common denominator

### Radicals
- **Product Rule:** $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$
- **Quotient Rule:** $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$
- **Power Rule:** $\sqrt[n]{x^m} = x^{m/n}$
- **Conjugate:** The conjugate of $a + \sqrt{b}$ is $a - \sqrt{b}$
- **Difference of Squares:** $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$

### Functions

## Part I: Multiple Choice Practice

### Problem 1: Domain of a Rational Expression

**Problem Statement:** Find the domain of the expression $\dfrac{x-2}{x^2-16}$

**Metadata:**
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Concept Tags:** [Domain, Rational Expressions, Restrictions, Factoring]
- **Skills:** Level 1-2 (Recall + Apply)
- **Prerequisites:** Understanding of domain, ability to factor quadratics, difference of squares
- **Common Mistakes:** Forgetting both values that make denominator zero; not expressing domain in correct notation
- **Related Problems:** Problem 8 (Functions), Problem 7 (Solving equations)
- **Alternative Questions:** "What values of x are excluded?", "Where is this expression undefined?", "Find the restrictions"
- **Spanish Terms:** dominio, restricciones, denominador

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Identify restrictions: The denominator cannot equal zero
2. Set denominator equal to zero: $x^2 - 16 = 0$
3. Factor: $(x-4)(x+4) = 0$
4. Solve: $x = 4$ or $x = -4$
5. **Domain:** $\{x | x \neq \pm 4\}$

**Why This Works:** Rational expressions are undefined when the denominator is zero, causing division by zero.

7. Factor: $0 = (x-1)(x-8)$
8. Solve: $x = 1$ or $x = 8$
9. **Answer:** $x = 1$ or $x = 8$

**Why This Works:** Multiplying by the LCD eliminates all fractions, converting to a polynomial equation.

**Critical Step:** Always verify solutions don't make any original denominator zero.

### Problem 8: Identifying Functions

**Problem Statement:** Which of the following relations is **NOT** a function?

A) $\{(2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)\}$
B) $\{(1,5), (1,7), (3,9)\}$
C) $\{(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\}$
D) $f(x) = x^2 + 1$

**Metadata:**

- **Alternative Questions:** "Is this a function?", "Does this pass the vertical line test?", "Does each input have exactly one output?"
- **Spanish Terms:** función, relación, dominio, rango

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Recall: A relation is a function if each input has exactly one output
2. Check option A: All inputs different ✓
3. Check option B: Input 1 appears twice with different outputs (5 and 7) ✗
4. Check option C: All inputs different ✓
5. Check option D: Functions always pass the definition ✓
6. **Answer:** Option B is NOT a function

**Why This Works:** For a relation to be a function, no x-value can correspond to more than one y-value.

**Key Concept:** A function CAN have the same output for different inputs (like option C), but NOT different outputs for the same input.

---

### Problem 9: Intercepts of Linear Functions

**Problem Statement:** For the function $f(x) = 2x - 8$, find the $y$-intercept as an ordered pair.

**Metadata:**

   $$\dfrac{(x+5)(x-2)}{(x-5)(x+5)}$$

4. Cancel common factor $(x+5)$:
   $$\dfrac{x-2}{x-5}$$

5. **Final Answer:** $\dfrac{x-2}{x-5}$

**Why This Works:** After factoring completely, we can cancel common factors that appear in both numerator and denominator.

**Restrictions:** $x \neq 5$ and $x \neq -5$ (from original expression)

---

2. Factor all expressions:
   - $x^2 - 16 = (x-4)(x+4)$ (difference of squares)
   - $x^2 + 3x - 10 = (x+5)(x-2)$ (factors: $5$ and $-2$)

3. Substitute factored forms:
   $$\dfrac{(x-4)(x+4)}{(x+5)(x-2)} \cdot \dfrac{x+5}{x-4}$$

4. Multiply:
   $$\dfrac{(x-4)(x+4)(x+5)}{(x+5)(x-2)(x-4)}$$

4. Add numerators:
   $$\dfrac{2x+4+5x-15}{(x-3)(x+2)}$$

5. Combine like terms:
   $$\dfrac{7x-11}{(x-3)(x+2)}$$

6. Check if numerator can be factored: $7x - 11$ cannot be factored further

7. **Final Answer:** $\dfrac{7x-11}{(x-3)(x+2)}$ or $\dfrac{7x-11}{x^2-x-6}$

**Why This Works:** To add fractions, we need a common denominator. Since the denominators are different linear factors, the LCD is their product.

**Note:** Both forms of the answer are acceptable.

### Problem 16: Simplifying Radicals with Variables

**Problem Statement:** Simplify completely (assume all variables are positive): $\sqrt{128x^5y^4}$

**Metadata:**
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
- **Concept Tags:** [Radicals, Variables, Simplification, Perfect Squares, Exponent Rules]
- **Skills:** Level 3 (Analyze)
- **Prerequisites:** Simplifying radicals, exponent rules, perfect squares
- **Common Mistakes:** Not extracting all perfect squares; errors with variable exponents; forgetting to multiply coefficients
- **Related Problems:** Problem 4 (Numerical radicals), Problem 6 (Combining)
- **Alternative Questions:** "Simplify the radical expression", "Express in simplest radical form"
- **Spanish Terms:** variables bajo el radical

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Break down into prime factors and perfect squares:
   $$\sqrt{128x^5y^4} = \sqrt{64 \cdot 2 \cdot x^4 \cdot x \cdot y^4}$$

2. Group perfect squares:
   $$\sqrt{64 \cdot x^4 \cdot y^4 \cdot 2 \cdot x}$$

3. Apply property $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$:
   $$\sqrt{64} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} \cdot \sqrt{y^4} \cdot \sqrt{2x}$$

4. Simplify each perfect square:
   - $\sqrt{64} = 8$
   - $\sqrt{x^4} = x^2$
   - $\sqrt{y^4} = y^2$

5. Combine:
   $$8x^2y^2\sqrt{2x}$$

6. **Final Answer:** $8x^2y^2\sqrt{2x}$

**Why This Works:** For variables under a square root, we extract pairs of the variable (or use $\sqrt{x^{2n}} = x^n$).

**Key Rule:** $\sqrt{x^n} = x^{n/2}$ for even powers; for odd powers, extract the even part and leave the remainder under the radical.

   $$x(x-3) \cdot \dfrac{4}{x-3} - x(x-3) \cdot \dfrac{2}{x} = x(x-3) \cdot 1$$

3. Simplify:
   $$4x - 2(x-3) = x(x-3)$$

4. Expand left side:
   $$4x - 2x + 6 = x^2 - 3x$$

5. Combine like terms:
   $$2x + 6 = x^2 - 3x$$

6. Rearrange to standard form:
   $$0 = x^2 - 5x - 6$$

7. Factor:
   $$0 = (x-6)(x+1)$$

8. Solve:
   $$x = 6 \text{ or } x = -1$$

9. **Verify $x = 6$:**
   $$\dfrac{4}{6-3} - \dfrac{2}{6} = \dfrac{4}{3} - \dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{3}{3} = 1$$ ✓

10. **Verify $x = -1$:**
    $$\dfrac{4}{-1-3} - \dfrac{2}{-1} = \dfrac{4}{-4} - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1$$ ✓

11. **Final Answer:** $x = 6$ or $x = -1$

**Why This Works:** The LCD method eliminates fractions; verification ensures no extraneous solutions.

**Critical:** Always verify! Sometimes algebraic manipulation introduces solutions that don't work in the original equation.

   $$\dfrac{8}{4-\sqrt{3}} \cdot \dfrac{4+\sqrt{3}}{4+\sqrt{3}}$$

3. Multiply numerator:
   $$8(4+\sqrt{3}) = 32 + 8\sqrt{3}$$

4. Multiply denominator using $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$:
   $$(4-\sqrt{3})(4+\sqrt{3}) = 16 - 3 = 13$$

5. Write result:
   $$\dfrac{32 + 8\sqrt{3}}{13}$$

6. This can also be written as:
   $$\dfrac{32}{13} + \dfrac{8\sqrt{3}}{13}$$

1. Substitute $x = -3$ into the function:
   $$f(-3) = (-3)^2 - 3(-3) + 5$$

2. Calculate $(-3)^2$:
   $$f(-3) = 9 - 3(-3) + 5$$

3. Calculate $-3(-3)$:
   $$f(-3) = 9 + 9 + 5$$

4. Add:
   $$f(-3) = 23$$

5. **Answer:** $f(-3) = 23$

**Common Mistake:** Forgetting that $(-3)^2 = 9$, not $-9$

#### Part b) Find $f(a+2)$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Substitute $x = a+2$ into the function:
   $$f(a+2) = (a+2)^2 - 3(a+2) + 5$$

2. Expand $(a+2)^2$ using $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$:
   $$f(a+2) = a^2 + 4a + 4 - 3(a+2) + 5$$

3. Distribute $-3$:
   $$f(a+2) = a^2 + 4a + 4 - 3a - 6 + 5$$

4. Combine like terms:
   - $a^2$ term: $a^2$
   - $a$ terms: $4a - 3a = a$
   - Constants: $4 - 6 + 5 = 3$

5. Simplify:
   $$f(a+2) = a^2 + a + 3$$

6. **Answer:** $f(a+2) = a^2 + a + 3$

**Key Skill:** When substituting expressions (not just numbers), use parentheses carefully!
